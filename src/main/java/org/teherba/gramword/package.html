<a target="_top" href="/webapps/gramword/"><strong>gramword</strong></a>    reads German text files, tries to determine the grammatical type of
    the words, and highlights them with different colors. There is an 
    attempt to determine the root and sometimes even the 
    semantical class of a word by matching it against 
    various predefined database tables. 
    There is no real syntax analysis (yet). 
    In one branch of the application,
    a local analysis of numbers and several key words is performed in
    HTML files, and hyperlinks are set on small segments of the text,
    for example on abbreviated bible references.
