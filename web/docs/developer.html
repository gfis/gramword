    <h2>Hints for Developers</h2>
    <p><em>gramword</em> currently recognizes only 
    a limited set of German words. There may be remaining mistakes in all
    algorithms and dictionary files.
    </p>
    <p>
    You are strongly encouraged to:
    <ul>
    <li>play with the dictionaries,</li>
    <li>email any hints for improvement,</li>
    <li>contribute patches for corrections,</li>
    <li>contribute new word / morphem detection algorithms.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Please try to remain close to the current programming style:
    <ul>
    <li>Write Javadoc comments before all methods and public members.</li>
    <li>Note that the Java sources are compiled with UTF-8 source encoding:
<pre>
    &lt;javac  srcdir="${src.home}" destdir="${build.classes}" listfiles="yes"
            encoding="utf8"
            source="1.4" target="1.4"
            debug="${javac.debug}" debuglevel="${javac.debuglevel}"&gt;
</pre>
    Determine the proper accents and non-ASCII characters, and write them
    in Unicode in the Java source files. 
    Use an Unicode enabled editor that handles 
    UTF-8 properly; note some Unicode characters in the header comment 
    such that the editor can detect the UTF-8 encoding.</li>
    <li>Use reliable sources for the word lists (much of the current material is from
    Wikipedia). Avoid dialects.
    </li>
    </ul>
