<h2>Decision Algorithm for Morphem Determination</h2>
<p>
The grammatical type of a word is determined by a tree (lattice) of tests.
Each test tries to match the word in question or some derivation
thereof against the tables in the database.
</p><p>

The following tests are implemented:
</p>
<ol>
<li><h3>Table Lookup Tests</h3>
These tests try to find the word or parts thereof in a database table. 
For the root and ending tests, an ordered, limited number of entries which
is less or equal than the word in question is examined.
</li>
    <dl>
    <dt>Exact Match</dt>
        <dd>The word is looked up in table <strong><em>words</em></strong> exactly as it was written.
        This table currently contains:
        <ul>
            <li>8360 conjugated forms of strong verbs</li>
            <li>470 most common pronouns, prepositions an other short words</li>
            <li>37 number word particles</li>
            <li>100 adverbs</li>
            <li>96 words related to time</li>
            <li>1049 most common first names</li>
            <li>1162 most common last names</li>
            <li>227 names of big German cities</li>
        </ul>
        </dd>
    <dt>Word Root</dt>
        <dd>Search for a left substring of the word in table <strong><em>roots</em></strong> .
        This table contains:
        <ul>
            <li>11000 roots of weak verbs ending on <em>-en</em>, <em>-eln</em> and <em>-ern</em>, 
                with various prefixes</li>
            <li>1927 (foreign) roots of weak verbs ending on <em>-ieren</em> with prefixes </li>
            <li>27 adjectives forcolors</li>
            <li>145 adjectives with irregular comparision forms</li>
            <li>169 adjectives related to quantities</li>
            <li>300 "primary" adjectives 
                which are not derived from substantives, verbs or other adjectives</li>
            <li>4900 "primary" substantives and names (1 syllable + optional ending 
                <em>-e</em>, <em>-en</em>, <em>-el</em>, <em>-en</em>, <em>-er</em>) </li>
        </ul>
        </dd>
    <dt>Word Ending</dt>
        <dd>Search for a right substring of the word in table <strong><em>xiffus</em></strong> 
        (<em>suffix</em> spelled backwards).
        The table contains:
        <ul>
            <li>122 common endings of substantives</li>
            <li>8360 conjugated forms of strong verbs</li>
            <li>684 common endings of adjectives, 
                declinated through all genders, cases and numbers</li>
            <li>12 common adverb endings</li>
        </ul>
        In order to find a word in the entries of this table, 
        the character order of the word and of the entries is reversed. 
        </dd>
    </dl>
</li>
<li><h3>Algorithmic Tests</h3>
    <dl>
    <dt>Number word</dt>
        <dd>Test whether the word starts with a German number word 
        (eventually followed by an adjective suffix like <em>-fach</em>, <em>-spurig</em>), 
        algorithmically with the aid of Java package <strong><em>numword</em></strong>.
        </dd>
    <dt>Digits</dt>
        <dd>Test whether the word consists of a sequence of digits ("0" ... "9") only.
        </dd>
    </dl>
</li>
<li><h3>Variant Tests</h3>
    The word in question is modified, and then the table lookup tests are retried.
    <dl>
    <dt>Lower Case</dt>
        <dd>Words starting with upper case are retried with lower case 
        (case error, new writing rules, unrecognized sentence start, 
        substantivated verb or adjective).
        </dd>
    <dt>Upper Case</dt>
        <dd>Words starting with lower case are retried with upper case 
        (case error, new writing rules).
        </dd>
    <dt>-ge-</dt>
        <dd>Retry the word after removing an embedded syllable <em>ge</em> 
        (e.g. <em>auf<strong>ge</strong>spalten</em>). 
        </dd>
    <dt>-zu-</dt>
        <dd>Retry the word after removing an embedded syllable <em>zu</em> 
        (e.g. <em>auf<strong>zu</strong>geben</em>). 
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
    The system allows that umlauts and the s-zet character 
    to be expanded in the text (ä &gt; ae, ß > ss etc.).
    All words with such characters are stored in the tables a second time, 
    in expanded form, with an "explicit replacement" morphem 
    which points to the "correct" writing
    (with regard to the new German writing rules since 1996).
